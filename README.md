# Home-Automation using ESP32 with Google home

This project implements a smart home automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller and Google Home. The system allows you to control various home appliances through voice commands via Google Home, enabling a seamless and convenient smart home experience. With the ESP32 at its core, the system is both affordable and highly customizable, making it ideal for DIY enthusiasts and tech-savvy homeowners.

KEY FEATURES:

Voice Control: Control your home appliances using Google Home voice commands for a hands-free experience.

ESP32 Integration: Leverages the versatile ESP32 microcontroller to connect and control various devices over Wi-Fi.

Real-Time Monitoring: Provides real-time status updates of connected devices, ensuring you always know the state of your home.

Customizable Setup: Easily customize the system to control different appliances or add new functionalities as needed.

Cost-Effective: A budget-friendly solution for smart home automation, using widely available components.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:

ESP32: Acts as the central hub, controlling connected devices such as lights, fans, and other appliances via relays or smart switches.

Google Home: Serves as the user interface, allowing you to send voice commands to the ESP32 through the Google Assistant.

Wi-Fi Communication: The ESP32 communicates with Google Home over Wi-Fi, ensuring a responsive and reliable connection.

Web Interface (Optional): Includes an optional web interface for manual control and monitoring of devices, accessible from any browser.

SETUP AND REQUIREMENT:

Hardware Requirements:

ESP32 microcontroller
Relays or smart switches
Wi-Fi network
Google Home device
Connected appliances (lights, fans, etc.)

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT:

Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
Google Home app
Required libraries (listed in Installation)
Steps:

Flash the ESP32 with the provided firmware using the Arduino IDE.
Configure your Wi-Fi credentials and Google Home integration in the code.
Set up the hardware connections (relays, smart switches, etc.).
